* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
[The current "swig" directory]
./export.i      SWIG interface definition
./export.h      C++ header file defining the API
./export.cpp	C++ implementation of the API

[Language directories]
The "swig" directory contains language subdirectories, e.g., python, ruby,
perl, java. These language directories store language-dependent staffs
(e.g., build/install script).


* BUILD INSTRUCTION
[Using the distribution package (*.tar.gz)]
$ cd language-directory
$ ./prepare.sh
$ # Run the language-dependent build script.

[Using the source repository]
$ cd language-directory
$ ./prepare.sh --swig
$ # Run the language-dependent build script.


The distribution package (*.tar.gz) includes a SWIG-generated wrapper for
every language, which is not managed by (committed in) the source
repository. It may be ideal for a user to generate a SWIG wrapper by
themselves, but the official distribution includes wrappers for the
following reasons: 
- To build SWIG bindings on the machine where SWIG is not installed
- To avoid errors caused by the version difference of SWIG
